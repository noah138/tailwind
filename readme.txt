To open the index.html file in a live server simply do the following

- Install the extension
- Navigate to /website/index.html
- Either use ctrl + shift + P and write live server & select "Live Server: Open with live server"
- Or right click inside or the index.html file and select "Open with live server"
- To run the app with live css compiling use the "npm run build:css" command which will automatically watch for live changes.

Hope you enjoy!
